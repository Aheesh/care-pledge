Public Goods Funding Dapp for Permissionless II Hackathon

# Introduction
In the realm of medical crowdfunding, there exists a significant gap in transparency and efficiency, especially for families traveling internationally for critical medical procedures like bone marrow transplants for sickle cell disease. Today, we introduce you to a solution that bridges this gap, fostering trust and efficiency in crowdfunding.
Problem Statement
The current crowdfunding landscape is fraught with challenges, including:
## Visibility of Funds:
- Donors often lack clarity on the accumulation and utilization of the funds they contribute.
## Fund Utilization Transparency:
- It's unclear how the funds are being used and whether they reach the intended entity.
## Case Status:
- Donors are left in the dark about the progress and current status of the medical case they have contributed to.
## Excess Funds Management:
- There is no clear mechanism to handle excess funds and whether they can be used for other noble causes or redirected to a general pool.

# Use Case Focus
We are focusing on a critical use case involving:
## Target Disease:
- Sickle Cell Disease requiring bone marrow transplants.
## Demographic:
