Project Name: Care Pledge (CP)

Description of Solution: Solving access to specialized medical services for Sickle Cell disease patients from Africa (e.g. Nigeria) requiring overseas (e.g. Singapore, India, South Africa) treatment via Public Goods funding utilizing blockchain technology. Aims to empower donors by providing transparency of usage of funds while repurposing additional funds (Regenerative).

# üé® Network Design

Care Pledge interacts with Allo Protocol - an open-source protocol which is deployed on Ethereum. This code heavily utilizes [Allo Docs](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2) in its development. Since Allo Protocol is maintained on Ethereum, this code is written in Solidity (code: [Care Pledge Code](https://github.com/baileyspraggins/care-pledge)) in order to have this code deployed on the Ethereum network.

## Why Privacy?

Two words - **Patient Privacy**.
A scientific study in 2020 spearheaded by [Nong et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33320264/) revealed that 21% of adults in US partaking in the study experienced healthcare discrimination. This data also showed that demographic and health-related characteristics aspects were the biggest factor of discrimination. In addition to this, the unconscious human bias is also wired to create perspectives that often cloud their judgements when making a decision to donate and support a good cause. Looking beyond discrimination; the healthcare system itself is also plagued with fraud and abuse, where the patients backgrounds are often subjectively evaluated during the billing process. This is a clear example of malicious activity which is full of oversights. Through the implementation of a medical crowdfunding utilizing privacy-preserved blockchain technology (Care Pledge), we will be able to keep patient information confidential while complying to regulations such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule and International Standards (e.g. ISO 27001).

## Privacy Solutions

Before we take a deep dive into privacy solutions, let's quickly recap the top three problems that Care Pledge would need to address in order to seamlessly integrate this product for users in Africa while complying to national health regulations.
1. Families or patients have limited capability to pay for services (Need cheap fees when interacting with the blockchain).
2. Care Pledge needs a platform to create a network of reputable affiliates and registered users to prevent fraudulent or abuse towards healthcare system.
3. Information verified by healthcare practitioners (HCP) needs to be kept confidential while providing proofs to donors (funding transparency).
Considering the available privacy blockchain solutions out there such as Aztec, ZKSync, and Nightfall - we would argue that Nightfall checks all our boxes for a privacy solution that best fits our needs.
