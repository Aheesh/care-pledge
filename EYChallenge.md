# üå± Project Info - Get to know us!
**Project Name:** Care Pledge (CP)

**Description of Solution:** Solving access to specialized medical services for Sickle Cell disease patients from Africa (e.g. Nigeria) requiring overseas (e.g. Singapore, India, South Africa) treatment via Public Goods funding utilizing blockchain technology. Aims to empower donors by providing transparency of usage of funds while repurposing additional funds (Regenerative).

# üé® Network Design

Care Pledge interacts with Allo Protocol - an open-source protocol which is deployed on Ethereum. This code heavily utilizes [Allo Docs](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2) in its development. Since Allo Protocol is maintained on Ethereum, this code is written in Solidity (code: [Care Pledge Code](https://github.com/baileyspraggins/care-pledge)) in order to have this code deployed on the Ethereum network.

## Why Privacy?

At the core of healthcare systems, privacy serves as the bedrock of trust between patients and healthcare providers. It ensures that sensitive information such as genetic data, diagnoses, treatment plans are safeguarded from malicious use. The protection of patient's privacy fosters open communication, which empowers patients to share critical information honestly to their healthcare professionals. By maintaining robust privacy safeguards, healthcare systems also indirectly achieves the capability to comply with legal requirements at a global scale - which ultimately contributing to the highest quality of patient treatments.

## Privacy Solutions

Before we take a deep dive into privacy solutions, let's quickly recap the top three problems that Care Pledge would need to address in order to seamlessly integrate this product for users in Africa while complying to national health regulations.
1. Families or patients have limited capability to pay for services (Need cheap fees when interacting with the blockchain).
2. Care Pledge needs a platform to create a network of reputable affiliates and registered users to prevent fraudulent or abuse towards healthcare system.
3. Information verified by healthcare practitioners (HCP) needs to be kept confidential while providing proofs to donors (funding transparency).
Considering the available privacy blockchain solutions out there such as Aztec, ZKSync, and Nightfall - we would argue that Nightfall checks all our boxes for a privacy solution that best fits our needs.
