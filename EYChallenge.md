# 🎨 Network Design

Care Pledge interacts with Allo Protocol - an open-source protocol which is deployed on Ethereum. This code heavily utilizes [Allo Docs](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2) in its development. Since Allo Protocol is maintained on Ethereum, this code is written in Solidity (code: [Care Pledge Code](https://github.com/baileyspraggins/care-pledge)) in order to have this code deployed on the Ethereum network.

## Why Privacy?

Two words - **Patient Privacy**.
A scientific study in 2020 spearheaded by [Nong et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33320264/) revealed that 21% of adults in US partaking in the study experienced healthcare discrimination. This data also showed that demographic and health-related characteristics aspects were the biggest factor of discrimination. In addition to this, the unconscious human bias is also wired to create perspectives that often cloud their judgements when making a decision to donate and support a good cause. Looking beyond discrimination; the healthcare system itself is also plagued with fraud and abuse, where the patients backgrounds are often subjectively evaluated during the billing process. This is a clear example of malicious activity which is full of oversights. Through the implementation of a medical crowdfunding utilizing privacy-preserved blockchain technology (Care Pledge), we will be able to keep patient information confidential while complying to regulations such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule and International Standards (e.g. ISO 27001).
